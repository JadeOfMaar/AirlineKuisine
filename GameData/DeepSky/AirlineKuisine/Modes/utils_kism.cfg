	@description = Reinventing the classic cabin was a decision met with surprising amounts of approval from C7 Aerospace. Not that C7 was expected to have a problem with the proposal anyway. Now someone came up with the brilliant idea to specify an array of specific internal layouts for the cabin specifically for the goal of effectively making a spaceplane into a liveable long-term abode, each rec centre then delegated to serve as a bedroom, lounge, gym, art room, stellarium, boardroom, you name it.

This means either more efficiency or more power from the same 'expected' size of a part. It's slightly better than the standard 1.25m thing.
