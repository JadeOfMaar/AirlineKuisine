	description = Versatility and Seamlessness are two watchwords that are minded very closely with this highly advanced device. Capable of the roles of two 1.25m converters simultaneously, or between the efficiencies of a 1.25m and 2.5m converter, the DS Mk2 Processor answers the call in-situ, like a badS.
