	@description = Reinventing the classic cabin was a decision met with surprising amounts of approval from both C7 and USI... Not that C7 was expected to have a problem with the proposal anyway. Now with only 2 motorized recliners (with seatbelts) instead of 4 cramped airline seats and edge tables, there's plenty room for crew or tourists to stow and unpack novelty things, live like they're home, keep fit, and let little ones crawl or float around all over the place. *Example uses: cupola, game room, den, dining, theatre, gym, janitorial, boardroom.
