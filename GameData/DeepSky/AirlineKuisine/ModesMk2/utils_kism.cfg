	@description = Reinventing the classic cabin was a decision met with surprising amounts of approval from C7 Aerospace. Not that C7 was expected to have a problem with the proposal anyway. Now someone came up with the brilliant idea to specify an array of specific internal layouts for the cabin specifically for the goal of effectively making a spaceplane into a liveable long-term abode. *Example uses: cupola, game room, den, dining, theatre, gym, janitorial, boardroom.

Staff and clientelle alike can expect to find truly first class amenities or community facilities and lots of private space here, rather than live in the game room. *Example uses: cupola, apartment, therapy, kitchen, large storage, engineer station.
