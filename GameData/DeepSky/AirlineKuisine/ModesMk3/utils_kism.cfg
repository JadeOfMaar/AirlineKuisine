	@description = Reinventing the classic cabin was a decision met with surprising amounts of approval from C7 Aerospace. Not that C7 was expected to have a problem with the proposal anyway. Now someone came up with the brilliant idea to specify an array of specific internal layouts for the cabin specifically for the goal of effectively making a spaceplane into a livable long-term abode. Unlike the Mk2 cabins, the Mk3 is geared towards personal and household-level living spaces and little more.

In comes this Mk3 sized Greenhouse. It's just as effective as the one from TripleZeta, and is form-fitting for interplanetary spaceplanes.
