	description = In contrast to the invention of the Mk2 Rec Centres, the Mk3 was devised with the idea that each and every hand on deck would have sufficient room for activities and equipment for the individual-level and household-level facets of life. This modified cabin provides no extra windows to scenic views but it should more than effectively settle those passengers who still feel packed like a sardine in any length of Mk2 cabin.
